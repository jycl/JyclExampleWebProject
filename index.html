    <p>This website is made with documentation that describes the basics to HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</p>
    <p>While the source code is meant to be informative, the website is quite simple.</p>
    <div>Here we have an unordered list created with:</div>
    <ul>
      <li>Open with &#60ul&#62</li>
      <li>Each list item is surrounded by &#60li&#62 tags</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <div>An ordered list is created different instead with:</div>
    <ol>
      <li>Open with &#60ol&#62</li>
      <li>Each list item is still surrounded by &#60li&#62 tags</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Learn more about this project by clicking <a href="README.md">here</a>. We create a <a href="https://www.google.com">link</a> using the  &#60a&#62 tag and href="" attribute.
    <br><i>Note: Make sure you add the http:// or https:// (the protocol) at the beginning if it is a web address.</i>
    </p>
    <p>Note that a stands for <i>anchor</i> and href stands for <i><b>h</b>ypertext <b>ref</b>erence</i>.</p>
